A Naive version of BlackJack.
_____________________________

Compile:
make

Run:
./blackjack

Classes Card, CardGame, Player are generic classes to extend them to build more card based games:


class GameServer can hold many CardGame objects. Games can communicate to the clients using the ServerChannel assigned by the GameServer.

ServerChannel is a stub class for now, it reads and write on the console but can be extended to add networking features to communicate with clients.

Blackjack:
Classes BJPlayer,BJDealer, Blackjack are blackjack related classes which extend Player,Player, CardGame classes respectively.

In this implementation of blackjack each player plays against the dealer(who is added by default in the constructor). So All players play against dealer.

BlackJack Rules:
* Cards are dealt, two per each player(including the dealer).
* The Players play first.
* for each player is asked to 'hit' or 'stand': 'hit' means get one more card, 'stand' means stop dealing more cards.
  If the player gets score > 21 at anypoint goes 'Bust'. If player stands and then this its the turn of next player and this process continues for all the players.
* At the end the dealer plays. The dealer's play is not automated right now. So someone has to play his part. I am right now playing for everybody :) since the ServerChannel is using cout and cin instead of 'networking' to communicate with clients.

* At the end results are announced using these rules:
  - If the dealer is not bust:
       then if a player gets his count more than dealer without being bust, he wins else loses, if a player scores same as dealer he 'squares' with the dealer.
  - If a dealer is bust:
       All players who are bust square with dealer.
       All players who are not bust win against dealer.

score:
* Any suit from 2-10 numbered cards count as the number on them.
* King, Queen, Jack all count as 10.
* Ace counts as 1 or 11 depending on if the player goes 'Bust' or not. 
  so if the cards are as below:

##########################
suit: Diamond, type: QUEEN
suit: Clubs, type: QUEEN
suit: Clubs, type: ACE
##########################
 your score is: 21

The Ace is counted as 1.

##########################
suit: Clubs, type: QUEEN
suit: Clubs, type: ACE
##########################
 your score is: 21

The Ace is counted as 11.

TODO:
* Modify ServerChannel to see if i can get 'real clients' connecting to server and join. Need to implement networking and come up with a protocol for communicating with induvidual clients to get client responses back to the game.

* Server is not threaded so cannot run more than one game at a time.

* Right now using main.cpp as driver for the gameserver and hence all the  games . To add more players just do:
  bj.join(0, "YOURNAME HERE");
  argument 0 is the index of game running in the gameserver. right now its just one game running at index 0 in server. so we are saying bj.start(0), to start our blackjack game.
